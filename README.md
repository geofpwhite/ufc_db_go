Redoing a project I made a few years ago for practice now that I have more experience with design. 

The purpose of the project is to provide 

A. A system that allows one to create a local DB by using an ORM (gorm) and scraping data from ufcstats.com's events / fights pages 
B. A simplified CLI that allows one to make predefined searches that I have deemed to be useful for data analysis while still requiring at least a somewhat complicatedly written query. ie. Combined record of a fighter's previous opponents, total strike accuracy, event finish percentage, etc.
